## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is JSX?
  JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows us to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript. JSX makes it easier to describe UI structures in a more readable and declarative way.

- How does React use JSX to render components?
  When a component returns JSX, React interprets it as a structure of elements and efficiently maps it to real DOM nodes during rendering.
