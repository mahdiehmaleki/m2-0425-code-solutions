## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a database schema?
  It is the structure or blueprint of a database. It defines how data is organized, including the tables, views, indexes, relationships, and constraints. In PostgreSQL, a schema is also a namespace that allows multiple users or applications to use the same database without interfering with each otherâ€™s tables or data.
- What is a table?
  A table is a collection of data organized into rows and columns. Each table represents a specific type of entity (such as "Users" or "Orders") and stores records related to that entity. In relational databases, tables are the primary structures used to store and manage data.
- What is a row?
  A row (also called a record or tuple) represents a single, structured data item in a table. Each row contains one value for each column, corresponding to the attributes of that record.
- What is an attribute and what other names are used to describe them?
  An attribute is a column in a table that describes a property or characteristic of the data stored in each row. Attributes are also commonly referred to as fields, columns, or data fields. Each attribute has a name and a data type.
