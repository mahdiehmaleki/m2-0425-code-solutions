## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are the 3 components of a fullstack Web architecture?
  The frontend that the user interacts with (Web site or Mobile app)
  The backend server that takes requests from the frontend and processes them
  The database where data is stored and used across all instances of the frontend
- What is Node.js and why is it useful?
  Node.js is a program that allows JavaScript to be run outside of a web browser. It is commonly used to build backend servers for Web applications.
- What are environment variables and how do you access them in Node.js?
  Environment variables are key-value pairs used to configure applications without hardcoding sensitive or environment-specific data (like API keys, database URLs, or secret tokens) directly in your source code.
  In Node.js, you can access environment variables using the process.env object.
- What is a REPL?
  REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop. It's an interactive shell that reads your input, evaluates it, prints the result, and loops back for more input. It's great for testing JavaScript code snippets quickly.
