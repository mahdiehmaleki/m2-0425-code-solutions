## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are modules?
  Modules are reusable blocks of code—like functions, variables, or classes—that are defined in separate files and can be imported into other files when needed. They help organize code, promote reusability, and improve maintainability in JavaScript applications.
- What is the difference between named and default imports?
  Named imports allow you to import specific variables or functions by their exact names using curly braces, while default imports bring in the single default export from a module without using braces.
- What is the difference between named and default exports?
  Named exports let you export multiple values from a module using their names, allowing selective imports elsewhere. Default exports allow only one value to be exported as the primary value from a module.
