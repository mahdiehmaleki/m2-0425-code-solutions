## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is Express useful for?
  Express is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Node.js. It's useful for:
  Building web servers and APIs quickly
  Handling HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.)
  Serving static files (e.g., images, HTML, CSS)
  Adding middleware for logging, authentication, and error handling
  Structuring web applications with routing
  It simplifies working with Node.js’ built-in http module.
- How does Express fit into a full-stack web application?
  Express acts as the backbone of the server-side in a full-stack web application. It’s a lightweight framework built on Node.js that handles routing, middleware, and HTTP requests/responses.
- How do you add `express` to your package dependencies?
  npm install express
- What Express application method starts the server and binds it to a network `port`?
  The app.listen()
- What is a network `port`?
  A network port is a virtual communication endpoint that helps computers distinguish between different types of network traffic. Each service or application on a device is assigned a specific port number—like how websites typically use port 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS. Ports ensure that data packets reach the correct process or service when transmitted over the internet or a local network.
